RV Automation Project - James Brandenburg - 04.09.2019

We are attempting to create an andriod based broker and client to talk to arduino controll devices found in a RV (motorhome)
for better comfort of full time living.  My prototypes are ESP8266 Wimos mini D1 clones so my digital pin to D# on the silk screen are not the same as you will see in the comments in conde so modify as needed for your ESP8266 based chip.

release log:
  04.09.2019 - 17:11 - uploaded 2 arduino schetches for prototyped heating devices.
                     - uploaded MQTT topic hierarchy.
               22:50 - updated code on both clients to only publish when temp and humidity changes.
